        <p>
          I love writing <strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong> and <strong>JS</strong> in service of fun, attractive and intuitive web experiences. I'm at my best when applying a mix of creative and technical skills to solve challenging problems with a small, focused team.
        </p>
        <p>
          Those I've worked with say I'm great at giving feedback and my secret power is filing tons of QA issues in a single, devastating swoop.

            This was my first real job in the industry and it was a really great place to start. Most of my work focused on creating promotional web pages and microsites that lived within the Future Shop website. I also had a lot of fun creating flash animations to promote the launches of the XBOX 360, Sony PSP and Sirius Satellite Radio. Additionally, I updated the Future Shop homepage with the newest specials on a weekly basis, a role known only as "Banner Duty". Sadly, not much of this work remains.
