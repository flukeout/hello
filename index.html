            As a member of the design team I'm involved in all aspects of the design process, including research, brainstorming, wireframing, prototyping and writing front-end code.

            I helped design, implement and test a wide variety of interfaces in our web-based mobile marketing platform. I was involved with all aspects of our design process, from initial concept sketches to working with our developers on markup and front-end code.

            I was also involved in a variety of UX activities, my favorite being user observation sessions where we watched and recorded users attempt to complete common tasks within our platform.

            In my second job, as the sole designer at the company for most of my time there, I got to be involved in a huge range of activities. My biggest contribution was redesingning the company website and overhauling the UX of the checkout and process.

            In addition to maintaining and updating all of the web properties, I also designed all of the print materials like business cards, letterhead, T-shirts, conference banners &ampt; magazine advertisements.

            This was my first real job in the industry and it was a really great place to start. Most of my work focused on creating promotional web pages and microsites that lived within the Future Shop website. I also had a lot of fun creating flash animations to promote the launches of the XBOX 360, Sony PSP and Sirius Satellite Radio, which I've linked below. I also updated the Future Shop homepage with the newest specials on a weekly basis, a role known only as "Banner Duty". Sadly, not much of this work remains.
